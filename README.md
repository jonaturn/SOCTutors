# Team Name: SOCTutors

Welcome to our NUS Orbital 2024 Apollo project!

**Motivation**:

SocTutors is a cutting-edge tutoring app designed to bridge the gap between
National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science (CS) students and
aspiring CS enthusiasts preparing for their undergraduate journey. Whether you're a
seasoned CS student looking to share your expertise or a pre-undergraduate student
eager to delve deeper into the world of computer science, SoCTutors provides the
perfect platform for seamless knowledge exchange and academic support.
Our motivation is deeply rooted in the belief that education should be accessible,
inclusive, and transformative. Here's why we've dedicated ourselves to creating this
app:

Empowering Aspiring Minds: We understand the challenges that aspiring CS
students face in navigating the complex world of computer science. By connecting
them with experienced NUS CS students, we empower them to overcome obstacles,
gain confidence, and realise their full potential in the field.
Fostering Mentorship and Collaboration: Mentorship is key to academic success and
personal growth. CS Tutor Connect provides a platform for meaningful mentorship,
where students can not only receive academic support but also build lasting
relationships with mentors who inspire and guide them on their educational journey.
Building Community: Education is not just about acquiring knowledge; it's about
building connections and fostering a sense of belonging. CS Tutor Connect cultivates
a vibrant learning community within the NUS CS ecosystem, where students can
collaborate, share ideas, and support each other in their pursuit of academic
excellence.

Promoting Academic Excellence: We believe in setting high standards for academic
achievement and supporting students in reaching their goals. By providing access to
top-notch tutoring services and resources, CS Tutor Connect promotes academic
excellence and helps students excel in their CS studies.
Driving Innovation: Computer science is at the forefront of innovation and
technological advancement. By nurturing the next generation of CS talent, CS Tutor
Connect plays a crucial role in driving innovation, solving complex problems, and
shaping the future of technology.

Democratising Education: Education should not be limited by geography,
socioeconomic status, or any other barriers. CS Tutor Connect democratises access
to high-quality CS education by providing a platform where students from all
backgrounds can learn, grow, and thrive.

Inspiring the Next Generation: We are passionate about inspiring and empowering
the next generation of CS leaders, innovators, and changemakers. CS Tutor
Connect aims to ignite a spark of curiosity, creativity, and ambition in every student
we reach, fueling their passion for learning and discovery
